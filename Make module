接下来尝试使用中文进行编辑
在对框架进行梳理后，特别感谢B站的大神提供的一些精彩的制作素材
也得益于失业半年的清闲，有时间对以往因工作无暇多投入时间的钻研
这段时间
没有各种负债的压力和世俗所要求的大事
也没有以往地产设计工作的各种问题解决所带来的各种电话、会议、面谈的聒噪
但并未因此懒散颓废
自律的早起家务免受妻子的指点
学习python，linux，mysql。了解了一些网安相关的知识
尝试做一些硬件来运行一些自动化的指令
但一直没有想明白这些学习怎么才能有价值输出，精神获得感以外的价值输出
3d打印机是最近的一个项目
打算做了第一台样机以后，进行后评估，并且到楼下的集市进行销售尝试
幻想以后做差异化，搞产品系列，儿童的，成人的，教研辅材的，小型工作室的等等
谁知道后面会怎样
先试试，说不定，下一次更新我没搞了，去某某公司做计算机软件、运维的销售了
反正是不搞房地产

After organizing the framework, I would like to express special thanks to the amazing creators on Bilibili who provided some fantastic production materials. Thanks to being unemployed for six months, I had the leisure time to delve into areas that I couldn't focus on due to work commitments.
During this period, I had no pressure from various debts or the demands of worldly matters. I didn't have to deal with the noise of phone calls, meetings, and interviews related to real estate design work. However, I didn't become lazy or decadent. I disciplined myself, took care of household chores without my wife's guidance, learned Python, Linux, MySQL, and gained some knowledge about cybersecurity. I also attempted to create some hardware to run automated commands.
However, I have yet to figure out how to generate valuable output from these learning endeavors beyond the satisfaction of personal growth. The 3D printer is the most recent project. After making the first prototype, I plan to evaluate it and try selling it at the local market downstairs.
I imagine diversifying in the future, creating product lines for children, adults, educational materials, and small studios, among others. Who knows what will happen next? I'll give it a try. Perhaps in the next update, I might have abandoned it and joined a certain company to work in computer software or sales for IT operations. Anyway, I won't get involved in real estate.
